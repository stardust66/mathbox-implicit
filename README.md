# Implicit 3D functions in MathBox

An example of graphing implicit functions in MathBox through the marching cubes
algorithm. Read more here:
http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/. The bulk of the algorithm is in
`src/marching-cube.js`.

MathBox is made by Steve Wittens: https://gitgud.io/unconed/mathbox.
